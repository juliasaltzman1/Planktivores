Here, you will find the code for the manuscript "Modeling Influences of Environmental Covariates on Planktivorous Elasmobranch Population Dynamics within an Isolated Marine Protected Area". The data used in this study is property of UnderSea Hunter, and therefore not available online. 

There are two sets of models in this code: Binomials and Zero Inflated Count Models. Our manuscript uses the count models. The data file is referred to as "cocos_environmental" in this code.
